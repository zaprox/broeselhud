<a href='Hidden comment: ==HUD options==

* aspect ratio in game

This gets auto-detected based on your screen resolution, adjust it if
you"re using a resolution with a different aspect ratio in-game.

* HP Display

You can enable an HP cross if you don"t like the numeric HP display.
Additionally, you can enable a team-colored border around the cross.

* oldschool Target IDs

Oldschool TargetIDs feature teamcolored plates and a healthcross, they
take up more screen space though.

* medpack / sandvich notification

This enables a notification that pops up next to your health when picking
up a medpack or sandvich.

==HUD crosshairs==

HUD crosshairs are a special type of crosshairs that have nothing to do with
the regular crosshairs which you can find in the advanced TF2 options. Despite
offering some advantages such as more complex shapes and outlines, they come
with the restraint that they can"t be changed on-the-fly in-game, meaning you"ll
have to edit/enable them manually via hudlayout.res or the Installer.

Step 1: Select your in-game resolution from the dropdown field.

Step 2: Click "Select & Customize Colors" to open the crosshair editor. When done, click "Save".

==HUD configs==

The Installer only remembers the path to the broeselhud .zip file and the
resolution you last selected for the HUD crosshairs.

If you want to store all your settings (options, colors, etc) in a file, click
"Export HUD config" and choose a destination and file name. To import them,
simply click "Import HUD config" and choose the configuration file.

If the path and resolution are not saved on successfull install, your config
(%AppData%\broeselhud Installer\bhIConfig.ini) is set to read only.
